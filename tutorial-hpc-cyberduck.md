# A Short Cyberduck Tutorial
*Don Teng, April 2017*

[Cyberduck]( works like Windows explorer, or a Mac Finder - it's a visual user interface which allows you to move files to and from your folder on a remote machine (like M3), and keep them organized. 

To log in, click on `Open Connection`, at the top right. In the pop-up window that appears:
 - Choose SFTP from the dropdown menu
 - Server: `m3.massive.org.au`
 - Port: 22 (or leave at whatever default number is given)
 - Username/Password: your M3 login details
 - Uncheck the `Anonymous Login` box
 - Whether or not you wish to leave the `Add to Keychain` box checked is up to you.
 
Click on the `Connect` button, and that's it.
