A bunch of notes from the BEAST 2017 workshop, held in London, 24 - 29 July. 

### Impressions
- BEAST is incredibly mathematical. 
- The primary output of BEAST (and BEAST2) is a probability distribution of trees. I guess that this is a discrete distribution of *n* trees, where each tree has a probability P(Tree<sub>i</sub>)

### Moving from BEAST to BEAST2
Install these add-ons in BEAUTi:
- bdsky - BDSKY functionality
- MASCOT
- StarBeast2
- CLASSIC_BEAST
- SNAPP
- BDSSM
- SCOTTI
- BACTER

These are basically a bunch of add-ons that were introduced in the workshop, some not very relevant, but get them anyway. To install a package, go to `File` --> `Manage Packages`. Select the package that you wish to install, and click the `Install\Upgrade` button. Restart BEAUTi for the changes to take effect. 

*Command line* - Coming soon.
