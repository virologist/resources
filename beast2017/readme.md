A bunch of notes from the BEAST 2017 workshop, held in London, 24 - 29 July. 

### Impressions
- BEAST is incredibly mathematical. 
- The primary output of BEAST (and BEAST2) is a probability distribution of trees. I guess that this is a discrete distribution of *n* trees, where each tree has a probability P(Tree<sub>i</sub>)
