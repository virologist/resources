# BEAST Tutorial
This is somewhat a cheat - I'm not actually writing the tutorial, but dropping a link to an [already excellent tutorial](https://github.com/trvrb/dynamics-practical) written by Trevor Bedford.  That tutorial gives a demo of a whole analysis pipeline from `BEAUTI` through to `Tracer`, `Figtree` and `TreeAnnotator`.  Ultimately, though, the more difficult question is about the most appropriate choice of parameters to select for the given study. 

This set of [Taming-the-Beast(2)](https://taming-the-beast.github.io/) tutorials are also useful, though applicable only to BEAST 2.
