# Introduction
This first introductory page contains a bunch of essential readings to get the basics first. But before we begin, read this article first, by Matt Gemmell, *[What Have You Tried?](http://mattgemmell.com/what-have-you-tried/)*

Useful sources: Wikipedia, Reddit Explain Like I'm 5 (ELI5), Stackoverflow (for programming), Youtube. A great portion of humanity's non-specialist knowledge can be accessed by using this magical tool:

## Things to Read up on
### Mathematical Concepts
 - Linear regression
 - Markov chains
 - **Maximum likelihood** (RAXML, IQ-Tree, FastTree - pros and cons. Provide references.)
 - Bayesian statistics (BEAST)

### Computation for Virology
 - [Models of DNA substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_DNA_evolution), from Wikipedia. 
 - **[How to interpret a phylogenetic tree]**(http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/how_to_read_a_phylogeny), by Andrew Rambaut. Or Khan academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/tree-of-life/a/phylogenetic-trees

### Programming
Having a good grasp on how to read, if not write, code is helpful. The Youtube channel [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_) is a good place to start.
