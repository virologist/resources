# Introduction
This first introductory page contains a bunch of essential readings to get the basics first. But before we begin, read this article first, by Matt Gemmell, *[What Have You Tried?](http://mattgemmell.com/what-have-you-tried/)*

Useful sources: Wikipedia, Reddit Explain Like I'm 5 (ELI5), Khanacademy (for undergraduate-level academic concepts), Stackoverflow (for programming), Youtube. A great portion of humanity's non-specialist knowledge can be accessed via the Google searchbar. 

The point here is not so much the mere acquisition of facts, but the ability to solve problems independently without needing anyone's help. Most people are nice enough to help you, but consider that a privilege, not an entitlement. No matter your personal goals, career aspirations, or stage in life, the whole point is to be able to solve problems that other people can't. Experiencing the frustration of multiple dead-ends, having to make decisions with incomplete (or no) information, or being dropped in the deep end with no backup, is all part of the process. 

## Things to Read up on
### Mathematical Concepts
Recommended youtube channel: [mathematicalmonk](https://www.youtube.com/user/mathematicalmonk)
 - Linear regression
 - Markov chains
 - Maximum likelihood (RAXML, IQ-Tree, FastTree - pros and cons. Provide references.)
 - Bayesian statistics (BEAST)

### Computation for Virology
 - *[How to interpret a phylogenetic tree]*(http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/how_to_read_a_phylogeny), by Andrew Rambaut. Or Khan academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/tree-of-life/a/phylogenetic-trees
 - [Models of DNA substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_DNA_evolution), from Wikipedia. 

### Programming
Having a good grasp on how to read, if not write, code is helpful, but not essential (though this is expected to change in future). The Youtube channel [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_) is a good place to start.

## Software We Use
 - **Multiple Sequence Alignment** - MAFFT.
 - **Tree computation** - RAxML, IQ-Tree, FastTree, BEAST package. Best installed using homebrew. 
 - **Tree drawing** - FigTree, TempEst, R (ggtree library)
 - **Other** - CDhit
