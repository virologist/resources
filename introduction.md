# Introduction
If you're here, you've probably been directed to this catalogue of tutorials because you're keen to develop some technical skills, maybe for computing in general, or computational skills for virology. This first introductory page contains a whole bunch of essential readings to get the basics first. 

### Programming
- *[What Have You Tried?](http://mattgemmell.com/what-have-you-tried/)*, by Matt Gemmell. 
- A python programming youtube channel for beginners, [thenewboston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBxCHonP6Ro&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_).  Note that that's Python 3.4; we're currently at Python 3.6 at the time of this writing, but the basics should have largely remained the same. 

### Computation for Virology
 - [Models of DNA substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_DNA_evolution), from Wikipedia. Note the section
 - **[How to interpret a phylogenetic tree]**(http://epidemic.bio.ed.ac.uk/how_to_read_a_phylogeny), by Andrew Rambaut. Or Khan academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/tree-of-life/a/phylogenetic-trees

### Mathematical Concepts
 - Linear regression, and its application in discarding crappy sequences
 - Markov chain
 - **Maximum likelihood** (RAXML, IQ-Tree, FastTree - pros and cons. Provide references.)
 - Bayesian statistics (BEAST)
