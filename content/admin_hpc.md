# R on the HPC
A bunch of admin notes for HPC admin.

## Installing shared libraries
Not sure if how to organize it such that users can install their own insulated packages if required (or maybe I'll just install packages on request to prevent compatibility debt from building up). Anyway, from within the R environment, use `.libPaths()` to see which paths are accessible to the R executable.

Libraries should be installed in `/usr/lib/R/site-libraries`. [source](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2003-October/041178.html). Use `sudo R` to start up R with admin privileges, and run:

```
install.packages("my_package", lib="/usr/lib/R/site-libraries")
``` 

Check out this University cluster webpage for how they did their setup: https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/r-language.php.
