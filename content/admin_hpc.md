# R Setup
A bunch of admin notes for HPC admin.

## Installing shared libraries
Not sure if how to organize it such that users can install their own insulated packages if required (or maybe I'll just install packages on request to prevent compatibility debt from building up). Anyway, from within the R environment, use `.libPaths()` to see which paths are accessible to the R executable.

Libraries should be installed in `/usr/lib/R/site-libraries`. [source](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2003-October/041178.html). Use `sudo R` to start up R with admin privileges, and run:

```
install.packages("my_package", lib="/usr/lib/R/site-libraries")
``` 

Check out this University cluster webpage for how they did their setup: https://www.chpc.utah.ed

# Python Setup

**IMPT: do NOT use `sudo pip install my_package`!** [Reason.](https://askubuntu.com/questions/802544/is-sudo-pip-install-still-a-broken-practice)

Containerization done using `conda`. See [this page](https://conda.io/docs/commands.html#conda-vs-pip-vs-virtualenv-commands) for conda vs. pip vs. virtualenv info. Some exploration commands:

* `conda info --envs` - to see what environments have been set up
* `conda list` - from an activated environment, to see what packages have been conda or pip-installed
* `pip list` - to see what packages have been pip-installed. 

Shared Anaconda installation: installed in `/opt/anaconda3`. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27263620/how-to-install-anaconda-python-for-all-users) SO post.
