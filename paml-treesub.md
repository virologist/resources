# PAML & Treesub
### [PAML](http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html)
...stands for *Phylogenetic Analysis by ML*. It has several uses, such as inferring ancestral sequences based on modern sequences, and so on. 

### [Treesub](https://github.com/tamuri/treesub)
This is an extension which uses some `PAML` functions, stitched together with RAXML and FigTree.
