# File Formats and Naming Conventions
## Virus Name Conventions
Virus names are often (but unfortunately not always) named like:

```
<virus>/<sample location>/<any other information>/<collection date>
```

Some examples of influenza B virus names:

```
B/Arizona/02/2002-05-04
B/Arizona/02/2002-05
B/Arizona/02/2002
```

The hassle of cleaning names is probably the most tedious, but necessary, chore. Watch out for all these: 
 - Duplicate name + Ids
 - Duplicate names
 - special characters and white spaces
 
 ## Frequently-used File Formats
 ### Sequence Data - `.fasta`, `.phy`
 ### Tree file extensions - `.tre`, `.nex`, `.nwk`
 ### BEAST input - `.xml`
