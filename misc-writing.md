# Writing & Communication

This is starting to become a sticking point in science, not just in terms of a scientist speaking to a non-specialist audience, but [specialists speaking to other specialists from other fields](http://blogs.agu.org/sciencecommunication/2010/10/26/dude-you-are-speaking-romulan/). 
- An [excellent article](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2010/11/24/on-jargon-and-why-it-matters-in-science-writing/) on excessive use of jargon in biology.
 - [Convoluted jargon](http://www.cbronline.com/news/cloud/aas/mystifying-it-jargon-creates-costly-uk-business-ignorance-4655127/) is expensive - there is a material cost of confusion and miscommunication.
 - [Excessive jargon](https://www.fastcompany.com/3052242/the-secret-to-sounding-smart-using-simple-language) (are you sensing a theme here?) makes the author sound stupid anyway.

My personal take:
 - Avoid jargon, or even big words, because this is not grade school and you don't have a teacher to give you a gold star for showing off your vocabulary. On the contrary, you're more likely, as a reader, to be impressed by a writer who can explain complex ideas in simple terms. Don't try to sound smart, just be smart.
 - Don't write like a scientist: stop using that writing style in publications which I think of as "academic deadpan". 
 - [Avoid passive voice](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/1aq96g/why_is_scientific_writing_mainly_in_the_passive/). Say *"I baked a cake"* instead of *"The cake was baked"* or *"The cake was baked by me"* - both of which sound super weird anyway! A common defence of using passive voice is that it "sounds objective". Don't try to sound objective, just be objective.

Stop using these words forever:
 - *utilize* - *"use"* is fine. 
 - *novel* - of course it's novel, otherwise you wouldn't be writing about it. 
 - *morphology* - *"structure"*, *"form"*, *"shape"* are all fine. 
 - *enrich* - if you're a bioinformatician. Many bioinformatics papers use this as a catch-all verb when they can't think of a better word. 
 
I hate the following words for their non-specificity. A rule of thumb is: if you can replace any of these words with the word "*stuff*", then it's a useless word. A common sentence is, for example: *"we did phylogenetic analysis on..."*, which doesn't tell you much more than *"we did stuff."*
 - *Analysis/study/investigate* - if it's not an operative word that tells the reader what actions I took, it's useless. I'd only use these if my intention is exactly to hide unnecessary, or not-yet-necessary, detail - but this is rarely the case in a publication, or in software documentation (where the point is exactly to tell the reader *all* the necessary steps). 
 - *Model* - Again, too vague. Almost all of applied maths is modelling.
