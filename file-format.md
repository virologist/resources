# File Formats and Naming Conventions
## Virus Name Conventions
Virus names are often (but unfortunately not always) named like:

```
<virus>/<sample location>/<any other information>/<collection date>
```

Some examples of influenza B virus names:

```
B/Arizona/02/2002-05-04
B/Arizona/02/2002-05
B/Arizona/02/2002
```
