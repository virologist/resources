# Introduction

## Contents
This is a collection of _get started_ pages and introductory tutorials for computational methods routinely used within the group, followed by details on access to high-performance computing access within Monash, and links to bioinformatics beginners tutorials.  Recommended prerequisites are listed at the top of that page. However, try as I might to make them so, there's no guarantee that each tutorial is entirely self-contained, but the idea is that you should be able to start anywhere.

0. ### Lab Admin

 - [data storage policy](./content/data_policy.png) - Data storage and archiving policy, in one nice infographic.

1. #### Theory and Software
 - [`Commonly used file formats`](./content/misc-file-formats.md) - Tutorial on commonly used file formats like `fasta`, `phy`, etc.
 - [`Multiple sequence alignment - introduction`](./content/alignment1-introduction.md) - How to do multiple sequence alignment, part 1
 - [`Multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT`](./content/alignment2-mafft.md) - How to do multiple sequence alignment (using `mafft`), part 2
 - [`Tree computation part 1: theory`](./content/methods-tree-computation1-theory.md) - A not-so-brief introduction to ML trees and BEAST trees.
 - [`Tree computation part 2: software`](./content/methods-tree-computation2-software.md) - How to use various programs to compute a tree, and their pros and cons
 - [`BEAST tutorial links`](./content/software-beast.md) - A link to existing BEAST tutorials.
 - [`PAML-TREESUB`](./content/software-paml-treesub.md) - How to install and use `PAML`, and an associated program, `treesub`.
 - [`RAxML`](./content/software-raxml.md) - How to install RAXML, and basic usage.
 - [Selection analysis with `HyPhy`](./content/selection-hyphy.md) - quickstart tutorial.

2. #### Using high-performance computers

 - [`hpc-resources`](./content/hpc-resources.md) - A quick overview of the HPC and data-serving resources available, and basic usage policies.
 - [`about-our-hpc`](./content/about-our-hpc.md) - How to use the lab's internal server, located in room 217
 - [`m3-quickstart`](./content/m3-quickstart.md) - A tutorial on how to send a job to M3.
 - [`m3-tips-and-tricks`](./content/m3-tips-and-tricks.md) - A dumping ground for how to use M3 slightly more efficiently.

3. #### Tech Tips
 - [`Software installation and prep work`](./content/things.md) - Software we used, and some basics to read up on.
 - [`Data wrangling with python`](./content/Tutorial%20-%20Pandas.ipynb) - Data wrangling with python, using the `pandas` library.
 - [`R-ggtree-demo`](./content/R-ggtree_demo.pdf) - How to plot some basic trees with `ggtree`, in R. This PDF document should be viewable in your browser, but doesn't always; you can download it to view it if required.
 - [`misc-learning-to-code`](./content/misc-learning-to-code.md) - tutorial on how to *learn* to code, not actually on how to code. Has links for the latter.
 - [`software-python-resources`](./content/software-python-resources.md) - A bunch of python resources.
 - [`software-tips-and-tricks`](./content/software-tips-and-tricks.md) - A dumping ground for miscellaneous bash or computational tips and tricks.
 - [`tech-github`](./content/tech-github.md) - Tutorial for basic command line usage of Github.
 - [`misc-writing`](./content/misc-writing.md) - How to write so that others can understand you.
 - [`London BEAST workshop notes`](./beast/readme.md) - Don's notes from London.
